`DG_on_China.yaml` is recommend to setup the python 3.7 environment.

## Abstract
This study presents a novel approach to predicting transit ridership within the framework of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) by employing a Deep Gravity Model (DGM) in Tianjin, China. Unlike traditional models, the DGM integrates deep learning with gravity modeling to better capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between TOD elements—Density, Diversity, and Design—and transit flows. Using Origin-Destination (OD) data from Tianjin’s metro system, this research demonstrates that the DGM significantly outperforms conventional methods in accuracy and predictive power. The SHAP analysis uncovers how TOD elements influence ridership differently depending on temporal contexts, such as weekdays versus weekends and peak versus off-peak hours. Key findings include the varying impacts of density and land-use diversity on transit use, and the critical role of design factors like parking availability and street network connectivity. These insights suggest the need for context-specific TOD strategies that adapt to the temporal and spatial dynamics of urban transit systems. This research contributes to advancing TOD theory and offers practical implications for enhancing sustainable urban mobility in rapidly urbanizing cities.
